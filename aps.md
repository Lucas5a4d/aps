## 1.1 basic information

hello, dear

My name is Zhang Ming, a software engineer, currently working in a start-up company in Chengdu, China. 

I graduated from the Dalian University of Technology in june, 2022.

I majored in software engineering during my university years and accumulated a wealth of project experience during this period.

My hobby, is playing badminton.

### 3.1.1 introduction

The university computer basics course is a course covering all aspects of computer science, including the foundation of computer systems, the representation of information and the basic working principles of computers**, the foundation of operating systems**, the foundation of **computer networks**, the foundation of **programmin**g, the foundation of **databases**.

### 3.1.2 five knowledge points

#### 3.1.2.1 The structure of a computer system

hardware+software

hardware:arithmetic unit, controller, memory, input device, and output device

software:program+data 

program:system software+application system



**The structure of a von Neumann type computer**

programs and data in external memory ,are first loaded from the external memory into the memory

(1) Represent programs and data in binary form.

(2) Computer hardware is composed of five major parts: arithmetic unit, controller, memory, input device and output device.

(3) Programs and data are stored in memory in binary form.

(4) The controller works according to the instructions (program) stored in the memory.

**Harvard architecture** is a memory structure that separates program instruction storage and data storage

**The difference** between the two is whether the program space and data space are integrated. Von Neumann structure data space and address space are not separated, Harvard structure data space and address space are separate.

**encapsulation**
Use abstract data types to encapsulate data and data-based operations to form anindependent entity. The data is protected within the abstract data type.
**inherit**
Inheritance is a technology that uses the definition of an existing class as a basis to create a new class. The definition of a new class can add new data or new functions, or use the functions of the parent class, but it cannot selectively inherit the parent class.
**Polymorphism**
Polymorphism means that after the properties and methods defined in the parent class are inherited by the subclass, they can have different data types or show different behaviors. This makes the same property or method have different properties in the parent class and its subclasses. meaning

## 3.3 ***Engineering** numerical method

Numerical Methods in Engineering is a course that studies how to use numerical methods to solve engineering problems



**Numerical Integration**: Learn how to perform integration using numerical methods.

Trapezoidal integral, Simpson integral, adaptive integral, Romberg integral and Gaussian integral

**Numerical Optimization Methods**: Learn how to use numerical methods for optimization.
**Numerical Computation of Differential Equations**: Learn how to solve differential equations using numerical methods.

Numerical solution: use several discrete points to calculate approximate values instead of exact values
Euler's method: Use matrix area instead of surface trapezoidal area
Improved Euler method: replace the trapezoidal area of the curved surface with the trapezoidal area
Runge-Kutta method:
Adams method: It is a linear multi-step method that uses multiple calculated values to perform calculations.
Lagrangian interpolation: constructor polynomial to approximate instead
The Adams method is approximately replaced by the functional polynomial of Lagrangian interpolation
